            <h3>Host a Wi-Fi hotspot with a Raspberry Pi</h3>
            <p>Dealing with hotel Wi-Fi is almost always a pain. Signing into a portal that doesn’t always work properly on every device — your phone, laptop, tablet, e-reader, watch, and more — is error-prone, and it’s an easy way to end up accidentally adding pricey internet fees to your hotel stay. Some hotel Wi-Fi only allows a single device per room! Most won’t let your devices communicate with each other, and if they do, they may well present a security risk.</p>

            <p>Internet advertising can often be a nuisance. It takes up valuable bandwidth. It weighs your browser down with trackers. It reports your data back to untrustworthy third parties.</p>

            <h3>How to build a Raspberry Pi cluster</h3>
            <p>Why would you build a physical cluster? Today you can go to Amazon, or Digital Ocean, or any of the other cloud providers, and spin up a virtual machine in seconds. But the cloud is just someone else’s computers: a Raspberry Pi cluster is a low-cost, versatile system you can use for all kinds of clustered-computing related technologies, and you have total control over the machines that constitute it. Building something from the ground up can teach you lessons you can’t learn elsewhere.</p>
