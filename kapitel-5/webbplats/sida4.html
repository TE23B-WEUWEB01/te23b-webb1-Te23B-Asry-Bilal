    <p>Manfred Mann were an English rock band formed in London in 1962. They were named after their keyboardist Manfred Mann, who later led the successful 1970s group Manfred Mann's Earth Band.[4] The group had two lead vocalists: Paul Jones from 1962 to 1966 and Mike d'Abo from 1966 to 1969. Other members of various group line-ups were Mike Hugg, Mike Vickers, Dave Richmond, Tom McGuinness, Jack Bruce (later of Cream) and Klaus Voormann.</p>

    <p>Prominent in the Swinging London scene of the 1960s, the group regularly appeared in the UK Singles Chart.[5][6] Their breakthough hit "5-4-3-2-1" (1964) was the theme tune for the ITV pop music show Ready Steady Go!.[7] The band achieved a UK and US No. 1 hit with "Do Wah Diddy Diddy" (1964),[6] which made them the first southern-England band to top the US charts during the British Invasion. The group scored two more UK No. 1 singles with "Pretty Flamingo" (1966) and "Mighty Quinn" (1968).[6]</p>

    <p>Beginnings (1962–1963)
        The Mann–Hugg Blues Brothers were formed in London in 1962[7] by keyboard player Manfred Mann and drummer/vibes/piano player Mike Hugg,[4] who had previously been members of a house band in Clacton-on-Sea that also featured Graham Bond.[8] Bringing a shared love of jazz to the British blues boom then sweeping London's clubs, the band was completed by Mike Vickers on guitar, alto saxophone and flute, bassist Dave Richmond and Paul Jones as lead vocalist and harmonicist.[4] At one point, the band included Tony Smith on bass guitar, Glyn Thomas on drums, and four brass members.[9][10] By this time they had changed their name to Manfred Mann & the Manfreds. Gigging throughout late 1962 and early 1963, they soon attracted attention for their distinctive sound.</p>
